## iSSL

This repo is a compilation of my personal research into image based Self-Supervised Learning. 
It is currently a work in progress but the plan is to cover these technolgoies.

 - [x] DINO based SSL (self-distillation + iBOT loss)
 - [ ] Efficient MAE systems (Hiere + MAE)
 - [ ] JEPA style objectives (latent space only)
 - [ ] CLIP objectives (weakly-supervised)
